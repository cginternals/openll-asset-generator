**What is openll-asset-generator?** (*llassetgen*)

The openll-asset-generator, or in short *llassetgen*, is a cross-platform C++ generator for font assets. Font assets are needed for rendering fonts in various realtime-applications.
With *llassetgen*, the user can adapt the parameters via CLI, GUI or can directly use the core lib. The GUI offers a pre-render using the generated font asset.

On the `master`-branch you will find everything tested using CI (Appveyor, Travis). On the `develop`-branch you find more features and fixes, but they are not thoroughly tested due to dependency issues on the CI servers.

**What is a font asset?**

A font asset consists of the data needed to render a font.
* The glyph atlas is a visual representation of the characters supported by the font. It can be a bitmap, a signed distance field, vector graphics, etc. The *llassetgen* creates signed distance fields as documented by Chris Green of Valve in the SIGGRAPH 2007 paper [Improved Alpha-Tested MagniÔ¨Åcation for Vector Textures and Special Effects.](http://www.valvesoftware.com/publications/2007/SIGGRAPH2007_AlphaTestedMagnification.pdf).
* The font description file contains the typesetting information that is needed to position each glyph correctly: the position in the glyph atlas, the position on the baseline (*advance*, *height*, ...) and the kerning data.

**Main Workflow**
1. Load the font file as it is found on your machine. Then generate a high-resolution bitmap image containing the glyphs.
2. Pack all glyphs into a glyph atlas for lower space consumption.
3. Render the distance field of every glyph. Input: high resolution bitmap image. Output: lower resolution distance field.
4. Export the texture atlas (i.e. the glyph atlas as distance field) and the font description file (i.e. information needed to use that atlas and to typeset the glyphs).

## Installation

### Windows

The core library and its applications can be installed either by downloading an installer, e.g., the latest x64 installer for Microsoft Visual Studio 2017, or downloading and extracting one of the precompiled archives, e.g. runtime, examples, and dev. Alternatively, download the source code and commence building from source. See [latest release](https://github.com/cginternals/openll-asset-generator/releases/latest).

### Ubuntu

We plan to provide the Font Asset Generator using PPAs. Until then, download the source code and commence building from source.

### OS X

We plan to provide the Font Asset Generator via homebrew package manager. Until then, download the source code and commence building from source.

## Build Instructions

### Prerequisites and Dependencies

For an alternative setup that only requires bash and Docker, see [below](#docker) (CLI only).

Necessary for the core library (*llassetgen*) and the CLI application (`llassetgen-cmd`)
* [CMake](https://cmake.org/) 3.4 or higher for building from source
* [Freetype](https://www.freetype.org/) to load and render fonts
* [libpng](http://www.libpng.org/pub/png/libpng.html) to import and export PNGs images.
* [fontconfig](https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/fontconfig/) on Unix systems.

Additionally necessary to build the rendering application (`llassetgen-rendering`):
* [GLM](https://github.com/g-truc/glm) 0.9.9.2 for OpenGL math and data structures
* [cpplocate](https://github.com/cginternals/cpplocate) to find run-time rendering shaders
* [glbinding](https://github.com/cginternals/glbinding) as OpenGL API binding
* [globjects](https://github.com/cginternals/globjects) to wrap OpenGL API objects
* [Qt5](http://www.qt.io/developers/) 5.0 or higher for GUI elements

### Compile Instructions

For compilation, a C++11 compliant compiler, e.g., GCC 4.8, Clang 3.9, AppleClang 8.1, MSVC 2015, is required.

First, download the source code [as archive](https://github.com/cginternals/openll-asset-generator/releases). or via git:
```shell
> git clone https://github.com/cginternals/openll-asset-generator.git
> cd openll-asset-generator
```

Then, depending on the version of globjects you want to build, choose the appropriate tag or branch, e.g., for the 1.0 release:

```shell
> git fetch --tags
> git checkout v1.0-master
```

The actual compilation can be done using CMake and your favorite compiler and IDE.

### Docker

For a simplified cross-platform build and usage setup for the CLI, a `Dockerfile` and two convenience scripts are provided:

#### Building
```
./build_docker.sh
```

### Running
```
./run_docker.sh <parameters>
```
The parameters are the same as described in the section below. The results are saved in the subfolder `output`.

### Troubleshooting
* /bin/sh: 1: ./configure: not found` during docker build: Make sure to clone the repo with linux line endings (LF).

## Usage

To see how to use our core lib, you can explore the following two applications that come with *llassetgen*: `llassetgen-cmd` and `llassetgen-rendering`. Further below you find details on the used algorithms and parameters.

### CLI
The CLI application `llassetgen-cmd` provides two subcommands:
- `distfield` applies a distance transform to an input image
- `atlas` generates a font atlas, optionally applying a distance transform and creating a font file in the FNT format.

The following examples introduce the basic parameters of `distfield` and `atlas`. To see a list of all the options, run `llassetgen-cmd distfield --help` or `llassetgen-cmd atlas --help`.

#### Examples
Take the existing file `image.png` and apply a distance transform, then write the result to `distancefield.png`:
```shell
llassetgen-cmd distfield image.png distancefield.png
```

Create an atlas for the Arial font containing only the glyphs 'a', 'b' and 'c', and write it to `atlas.png`:
```shell
llassetgen-cmd atlas --fontname Arial --glyph abc atlas.png
```

Create an atlas containing all printable ASCII glyphs, with a font size of 256 pixels, then use the Parabola Envelope algorithm to apply a distance transform. Write the resulting distance field to `atlas.png` and generate an FNT file, which is written to `atlas.fnt`:
```shell
llassetgen-cmd atlas --ascii --fontsize 256 --distfield parabola --fontname Arial atlas.png --fnt
```

Since a distance field creates a "glow" around every glyph, add 20 pixels of padding around each glyph in the atlas to create the necessary space. To improve the final rendering quality of the font, apply a 4x downsampling to every glyph:
```shell
llassetgen-cmd atlas --padding 20 --downsampling 4 --ascii --distfield parabola --fontname Arial atlas.png
```

### Rendering
Additionally to the CLI, you can use the GUI-application `llassetgen-rendering`. It offers a preview of the rendering using the calculated distance field. Using the GUI, you can change all parameters and see their direct impact on the final image.

`llassetgen-rendering` uses the fragment-shader as in [OpenLL](http://openll.org/) for Super Sampling. Rendering parameters are:

<dl>
  <dt>Super Sampling</dt><dd>Choose the type of Super Sampling.</dd>
  <dt>Threshold</dt><dd>The default value is 0.5, since the Distance Transform considers 0.5 as the contour. Choosing a smaller value renders the glyphs bold; a larger value renders them thinner, until they completely disappear. A smaller value than 0.3 is clamped to 0.3, because such fragments are dicarded in fragment shader for performance reasons.</dd>
  <dt>Switch Rendering</dt><dd>You can toggle between rendering the calculated distance field or rendering the resulting glyphs when using the calculated distance field.</dd>
</dl>


## Details on Algorithms and Parameters

<dl>
  <dt>Font Name</dt><dd>The font is loaded from the local machine using the given font name, e.g. Arial, Verdana</dd>
  <dt>(Original) Font Size</dt><dd>This size is used to pre-render the glyphs before the Distance Transform is applied. A higher value results in smoother fonts (high resolution font), but the Distance Transform performs slower. We encourage larger font size, as the Distance Field is only generated once.</dd>
  <dt>Padding</dt><dd>Space that is added around the glyphs. Gives more space for dynamic range of distance transformed glyphs. That means, the glyphs get 'larger' and thus need more space to not be cut off.</dd>
  <dt>Downsampling</dt><dd>Distance Fields are meant to be downsampled. We offer different downsampling types and also different scaling factors.</dd>
  <dt>Dynamic Range</dt><dd>The Distance Transform calculates values, that need to be clamped in order to generate a PNG. Choose the min (black) and max (white) values. A lower black value will make the distance fields wider; a lower white value will make the distance fields brighter. In most cases, the black value should be lower than the white value. However, swapping the black and white value will invert the colors of the atlas.</dd>
</dl>

### Packing

Our implemented packing algorithms are based on the publication by Jukka Jyl√§nki: [A thousand ways to pack the bin -- a practical approach to two-dimensional rectangle bin packing (2010)](http://clb.demon.fi/files/RectangleBinPack.pdf), except that for now, we don't use multiple bins (i.e. textures).

The *Shelf Bin Packing* (O(n log(n))) performs faster, but there are cases where *Max Rects Packing* (O(n^5)) gives better results.

Parameters: All glyph sizes, downsampled.

### Distance Transform

*llassetgen* offers two algorithms for the distance field creation:

The Algorithm "Dead-Reckoning" is based on: [GREVERA, George J. The ‚Äúdead reckoning‚Äù signed distance transform. Computer Vision and Image Understanding, 2004, 95. Jg., Nr. 3, S. 317-333.](http://perso.ensta-paristech.fr/~manzaner/Download/IAD/Grevera_04.pdf).
There are 10 accesses per pixel over 4 passes.

The Algorithm called "Parabola Envelope" is based on: [FELZENSZWALB, Pedro; HUTTENLOCHER, Daniel. Distance transforms of sampled functions. Cornell University, 2004.](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~dph/papers/dt.pdf).
There are 4 accesses per pixel over 2 passes, thus this algorithm is considerably faster than the "Dead-Reckoning" while *not* resulting in a lower quality distance field.

#### Parameters:

<dl>
  <dt>Input</dt><dd>Bitmap image containing a mask which indicates where the charater is filled (true = inside, false = outside). The necessary padding should already be included in the input.</dd>
  <dt>Output</dt><dd>Float image containing the signed distance to the closest edge, measured in pixels. The output can be rendered to a PNG file by assigning a dynamic range (black & white distance value), which also clamps all values above and below that range.</dd>
</dl>
